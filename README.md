# Teams - start games fast!


Teams is a fast way to split up a group of people into random teams, just create a game and share the link.

Teams was build from watching the frustrations of Verena, a youth leader who would expend way too much effort organising the youth into groups to start a game.

I pray that this app means for you, less time organising and more time having fun with friends.
